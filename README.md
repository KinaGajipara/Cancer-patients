Problem Statement: 1
Developed a Random Forest model achieving the highest Recall to assess the impact of patient attributes (age, gender, lifestyle) and environmental exposures (air pollution, dust allergy) on cancer risk levels, 
identifying significant correlations that inform targeted health interventions.

Problem Statement: 2
Utilized a Random Forest model with the highest Recall to identify primary factors contributing to chronic lung disease and related respiratory issues, uncovering gender disparities in drinking habits 
and the influence of environmental factors on health outcomes for effective prevention strategies.
