Problem Statement: 1
- The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model to classify cancer patients as having harmful or benign tumors based on data. The model aims to assist in early detection, improving diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

- Developed a Random Forest model achieving the highest Recall to assess the impact of patient attributes (age, gender, lifestyle) and environmental exposures (air pollution, dust allergy) on cancer risk levels, 
identifying significant correlations that inform targeted health interventions.

Problem Statement: 2
- The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model to classify patients with chronic lung disease based on data. The model aims to assist in early detection, improving diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

- Utilized a Random Forest model with the highest Recall to identify primary factors contributing to chronic lung disease and related respiratory issues, uncovering gender disparities in drinking habits 
and the influence of environmental factors on health outcomes for effective prevention strategies.
